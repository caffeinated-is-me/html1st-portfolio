<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Shreya Singh pursuing B.Tech CSE at Thapar University, Patiala</p>

<p>I am deeply passionate about the world of design and have recently been exploring my creativity through the use of Blender, a powerful 3D modeling and animation software.</p>

<p>As an aspiring computer scientist, I find the intersection of technology and design fascinating. The ability to combine logical thinking with aesthetic creativity is what drew me towards both computer science and designing.</p>
<p>Alongside my academic pursuits, I have a profound love for art and creative endeavors, including designing as well as engaging in dancing, paintings, event management, and anchoring.</p>
<p>Thank you, will look forward to connect with professionals and fellow enthusiasts from diverse backgrounds</p>
